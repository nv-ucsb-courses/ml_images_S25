## Introduction to machine learning for biological images and structural biology

**Instructor: Niels Volkmann**

**Course Description**

This course offers an introduction to machine learning for students with a biological or bioengineering background. A strong background in computer science is not required but a solid understanding of basic linear algebra and calculus is expected. The course is particularly focused on applications in bioimaging and structural biology. We'll start with a history of artificial intelligence to set the stage, then move into the basics of neural networks, helping you understand the key components that power these systems. As the course progresses, we'll explore modern machine-learning techniques like convolutional neural networks, transformers, autoencoders, and deep Q-learning, paying special attention to how these can be applied to bioimaging and structural biology problems. The final part of the course is dedicated to student presentations, where you'll choose and discuss research papers, giving you a chance to dive deeper into specific topics that interest you. By the end of the course, you should be equipped with a solid foundation in machine learning concepts and their practical applications in bioimaging and structural biology.

### Grading
15% Participation, 15% Quizzes, 70% Presentation

### iClicker

For quizzes and polls, we will use iClicker in class. If you have not already done so, please make sure you have a UCSB iClicker student account ready. Here is a [link](https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360054938191-iClicker-Cloud-for-Students) with the pertinent information. The join link for the course is [here](https://join.iclicker.com/UCLU). If the ink does not work, try searching for "ML for Bioimaging" in the iClicker search interface. Be aware that the in-class iClicker activities will count towards your grades. For polls, I will give credit for participation only, the correctness of the answers will not influence the grades. For quizzes, of course, the grading will depend on the answers.  If you miss an iClicker activity without prior approval, you will not be able to make up for it.


### Presentation Format
15 minutes presentation (sharp), 5 minutes for questions. Papers can either be selected from the list provided later or from the general literature upon approval by the instructor.

### Reference Material
Generally, textbooks do not adequately cover the areas we are discussing due to the exponential development curve of the field. This rapid advancement means that even recently published books can quickly become outdated. Nevertheless, here are three excellent textbooks that cover most of the basic concepts in depth:
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition (2020) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
* Deep Learning (2016) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, Free online version [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
* Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision (2021) by Valliappa Lakshmanan, Martin Görner & Ryan Gillard

For many of the topics we discussed that are not covered in these books, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) often serves as a useful initial resource, although the quality can vary. I will also provide some additional resources during this course on this site.
