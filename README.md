## Introduction to machine learning for biological images and structural biology

**Instructor: Niels Volkmann**

### Course Description

This course offers an introduction to machine learning for students with a biological or bioengineering background. A strong background in computer science is not required but a solid understanding of basic linear algebra and calculus is expected. The course is particularly focused on applications in bioimaging and structural biology. We'll start with a history of artificial intelligence to set the stage, then move into the basics of neural networks, helping you understand the key components that power these systems. As the course progresses, we'll explore modern machine-learning techniques like convolutional neural networks, transformers, autoencoders, and deep Q-learning, paying special attention to how these can be applied to bioimaging and structural biology problems. The final part of the course is dedicated to student presentations, where you'll choose and discuss research papers, giving you a chance to dive deeper into specific topics that interest you. By the end of the course, you should be equipped with a solid foundation in machine learning concepts and their practical applications in bioimaging and structural biology.

### Chat/Discussions

I set up a chat in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/nv-ucsb-courses/ml_images_S25/discussions/1) of this site as a class forum for you to post questions about the course or other public questions and share ideas or links.

-	Identify and explain the key components and architectures of neural networks, including how they process and learn from data.
-	Gain familiarity with advanced machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, autoencoders, and deep Q-learning.
-	Gain an understanding of how to apply machine learning methods to bioimaging and structural biology.
-	Develop and present a comprehensive overview of a selected paper, demonstrating the ability to synthesize and communicate complex ideas effectively.


### Prerequsites
Basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra. 

### Office Hours
After class or via Zoom by appointment


### Grading
15% Participation, 15% Quizzes, 70% Presentation

### iClicker

For quizzes and polls, we will use iClicker in class. If you have not already done so, please make sure you have a UCSB iClicker student account ready. Here is a [link](https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360054938191-iClicker-Cloud-for-Students) with the pertinent information. The join link for the course is [here](https://join.iclicker.com/UCLU). If the ink does not work, try searching for "ML for Bioimaging" in the iClicker search interface. Be aware that the in-class iClicker activities will count towards your grades. For polls, I will give credit for participation only, the correctness of the answers will not influence the grades. For quizzes, of course, the grading will depend on the answers.  If you miss an iClicker activity without prior approval, you will not be able to make up for it.


### Presentation Format
15 minutes presentation total (sharp), allow a minimum of 2 minutes for questions. Papers can either be selected from the list provided  [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/dmxzezrx4yztq98p5jf9f/APhHThb5mSrmXrMMKzYlTkg?rlkey=vtog00ryx9oc1329h77pz6ew8&dl=0) (first come first serve) or from the general literature upon approval by the instructor. Papers that have already been selected by someone will show up as _\<papertitle\>_\__TAKEN_\__\<NAME\>.pdf_ (where \<papertitle\> and \<NAME\> are variables). 

We will use 3 timeslots for the presentations. Two will fall into the finals week, and one will be the last timeslot for the regular classes. In the interest of fairness, I will calculate the order of the presentations live during the last class before the presentations using the Python random generation capabilities. This will ensure that everyone has to be ready with their presentation at the same time. I will also incorporate attendance at the three presentation sessions into the presentation score. 

### Presentation Schedule

#### June 3rd (2:00 PM - 3:15 PM)

* Jiatong - _Attention Is All You Need_
* Bowen - _An image is worth 16X16 words: transformers for image recognition at scale_
* Emily J - _High-precision automated reconstruction of neurons with flood-filling networks_
* Yanwei - _DeepNeuron: an open deep learning toolbox for neuron tracing_


### Reference Material
Generally, textbooks do not adequately cover the areas we are discussing due to the exponential development curve of the field. This rapid advancement means that even recently published books can quickly become outdated. Nevertheless, here are three excellent textbooks that cover most of the basic concepts in depth:
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition (2020) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
* Deep Learning (2016) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, Free online version [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
* Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision (2021) by Valliappa Lakshmanan, Martin Görner & Ryan Gillard

For many of the topics we discussed that are not covered in these books, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) often serves as a useful initial resource, although the quality can vary. I will also provide some additional resources during this course on this site.
